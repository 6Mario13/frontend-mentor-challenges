# Four Card Feature Section

This is my solution to the **Four Card Feature Section Challenge** from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges). This project helped me practice building modern, responsive layouts and component-based designs using HTML and CSS.

- Clean, modern card components with SVG icon.
- Consistent spacing and alignment for a visually appealing design.

---

## Built With

- **HTML5**: Semantic and accessible structure.
- **CSS3**: Grid layout for organizing the cards and Flexbox for alignment.
